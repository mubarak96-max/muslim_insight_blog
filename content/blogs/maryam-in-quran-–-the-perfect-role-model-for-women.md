Maryam inn [Quran](https://musliminsight.net/facts-about-quran/) is mentioned over 34 times, more times than she is talked about in the Bible. She is the most righteous woman ever and the best among. She is one of the two women who have ever attained perfectionism.

*The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Many men achieved perfection, but among women, only Maryam the daughter of Imran and Asiah, the wife of Fir’awn (Pharoah)*

*In another hadith, he said: The best of women among the people of Paradise are, Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, Fatimah bint Muhammad, Maryam bint Imran and Asiah bint Muzahim, the wife of Pharaoh.*

Maryam would be the right role model for any woman, mother or daughter. Not actresses or singers, whose role is to market products and spread immorality.

### Maryam’s father

*Allah says in the Quran, “Allah chose Adam, Nuh (Noah), the family of Ibrahim and the family of Imran above. Offspring, one of the other, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.” (3:33-34)*

The father of Maryam was called Imran. He is from the lineage of prophet Dawud (David). Imran’s family is among those chosen by Allah, the Most High to be above all people and nations. From him comes Maryam and from her comes prophet Isa (Jesus) who is one of the five top prophets.

### Her mother

Maryam’s mother was called Hannah bint Faqudh. Hannah reached her evening age without having any child. At one time, she saw a bird providing food to its young one. She then wished to have children by herself. She supplicated to Allah to enable her get a child and when she slept with her husband, she got pregnant. At seeing the pregnancy, she made a pledge to devote her child to worshipping Allah and giving service to Bayt Al-Maqdis (the holy Mosque in Jerusalem).

*Allah says in the Quran: “Remember when the wife of Imran said; O my Lord! I have vowed to You what is in my womb to be dedicated for Your services, so accept this from me. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing.” (3:35)*

*“But when she delivered her, she said; “My Lord I have delivered a female”. And Allah was most knowing of what she delivered. “And the male is not like the female. And I have named her Maryam (Mary), and I seek refuge for her in You and for her descendants from Satan, the expelled from Allah’s mercy.” (3:36)*

When Hannah gave birth, she saw a girl yet she had desired for a boy. She saw that a boy would be better suited to do the work in service of Allah, stronger in commitment to worship Allah and serving in the Mosque.

This usually happens where most people prefer giving birth to boys than girls. They think boys are stronger, less prone to temptations and easier to bring up. But in Islam, no child is better than the other. A boy or a girl, each can be better than the other and their superiority depends on their devotion to Allah. A boy who is arrogant, take in drugs, a thief, doesn’t pray, cannot be any better than a girl who prays, modest and subservient to Allah. Also a girl who is immoral cannot be better than a Muslim practicing boy.

Even though she wanted a boy, Hannah accepted Allah’s decree of giving birth to a girl and she named the child Maryam. She supplicated to Allah to keep her daughter away from the evil of Satan and her offspring, which later came to be prophet Isa (peace be upon him).

*The prophet (peace be upon him said): Every newly born baby is touched by Satan when it is born, and the baby starts crying because of his touch, except Maryam and her son.*

Maryam was a great woman, but it all didn’t come out of nowhere. Her mother was a righteous woman who trusted all her affairs with Allah. She devoted her child (Maryam) to the service of Allah and when she was born, she prayed to Allah that the child be saved from the works of the devil. This is the line which should be followed by women who want righteous children.

### Maryam’s upbringing

Maryam grew up in a good manner and was so liked by people. She grew up in honor and learnt righteousness, knowledge and religion as she was under the guardianship of prophet Zakariyya who was a prophet to the children of Israel by then. He was the husband of her maternal aunt Zakariyya was the father of prophet Yahya (John), him and Isa were maternal cousins.

Maryam had a special private room where she could spend time alone in seclusion worshipping Allah. Zakariyyah often saw astonishing miracles from her, he was amazed to often find her with food. He would find her with summer fruits during winter and winter fruits during summer. This was one of the special favors granted to her by Allah. She received food directly from Him.

*“Every time he entered the mihrab to visit her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said; O Maryam! From where have you gotten this. She said; This is from Allah, Verily, Allah provides sustenance to whom He wills.” (3:37).*

Allah was always with her as He is always with those who remember Him. If Allah is with you, He can make anything easy for you.

### Maryam was chosen to be the leader of all women

Maryam was chosen by Allah to be above all women. She was modest, honorable, innocent and had a total conviction in Allah.

*From the Quran: “And when the angels said; O Maryam, indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the nations.” (3:42).*

### Conceiving the pregancy for Isa (Jesus)

 “And when the angels said; O Maryam, indeed Allah give you good tidings of a word from Him. Whose name will be the Messiah, Isa (Jesus) the son of Maryam, distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought near to Allah. He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous. She said; My Lord, how will I have a child when no man has touched me? \[The angel] said; Such is Allah, He creates what He wills. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, ‘Be’ and it is.” (3:45-47)

Maryam could seclude herself from people at the eastern side of the sacred Mosque in Jerusalem. One time she was there and Allah sent to her angel Jibril (Gabriel) in the form of a well-proportioned man. When she saw him, she sought refuge in Allah from the man. She was afraid he would sexually harass her. He (Gabriel) then said to her that he was just a messenger who had brought news of the gift of a righteous son. She retorted that she couldn’t have a son since she had never been touched by a man and was chaste. He made it clear to her that it is a simple matter to Allah which He will make as a sign for people, as one of the indications of His power as the Creator and Maker.

She conceived and after the sometime, she went to a remote place where she gave birth from in pain. After giving birth, she went back to her people with a baby. She was commanded by Allah not to speak to any person.

*“…Say; Verily, I have vowed to fast unto the Most Gracious, so I shall not speak to any human being today.” (19:26).*

When they saw her, they made a big deal about her situation and they protested against it.

*“Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said; O Maryam, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented. O sister of Harun (Aaron), your father was not a man of evil, nor your mother unchaste.” (19:27-28)*

They told her that she had committed a mighty thing which was not expected of her. She was from a good pure family known for its righteousness, worship and abstinence from worldly indulgence. Her father did not commit any adultery nor her mother was unchaste. How could she do that! She was referred to as sister of Harun (Aaron) because she is a descendant of Musa whose brother was Harun (Aaron).

But as they were talking whatever they wanted about her. She left her affair to be taken care of by Allah and establish proof of her rightness, she just kept quiet as was commanded.

*“So she pointed to him. They said; How can we speak to one who is a child in the cradle?” (19:29)*

As they were slandering and falsely accusing her about the matter, she pointed to the child. She directed them to speak to the child. This was a kind of mockery to them for which they scoffed at her. They took this even greater than the fornication they had accused her at first. But after then, the child indeed spoke to them.

*The prophet (peace be upon him said); No infant spoke in the cradle except Isa (Jesus) and the companion of Jurayj.*

*“(Jesus) said; indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the scripture and made me a prophet. And He made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as I remain alive. And dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched tyrant. And peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I an raised above.” (19:30-33)*

The child who was Isa (Jesus) proved his mother’s innocence by speaking to them. He saved her mother from the crucifixion she was going through. The child pointed out to them that he was a servant of Allah crossing out what the Christians say that he is god or a son of God. He further declared that he had been given the scripture and prophethood, made blessed and enjoined upon prayer and giving out zakah. Isa (Jesus) was also made to be dutiful to his mother who was being scorned at and he didn’t mention about his father. He was born without a father and that is from the power of Allah who creates as He wills.

More about this story can be found in the Quran chapter 19 Surat Maryam, from from verse 16 to 37.

### In summary, lessons women can pick from Maryam and apply in their lives so that they follow her in the line of righteous women.

Starting from her parents, her dad Imran was a righteous man and her mother Hannah was a righteous woman too. Even before she conceived Maryam, she put her affairs in Allah’s hand. When Maryam was born, she devoted her to the service of Allah and prayed to Allah to keep her away and her descendants from the cursed Satan. This indicates that the righteousness of a child largely depends on the condition of the parents, a barren soil cannot produce good fruits. If one wants a child like Maryam, he/she should first make sure he/she is a righteous person whose affairs are rest well with Allah.

Maryam was put in guardianship of Zakariyya who was a prophet, a man of knowledge and righteousness. If any child is to become like Maryam, he/she should be brought up in the eyes of religious people who could always guide him/her, showing the difference between right and wrong. Unfortunately, these days kids are left to grow up in the influence of bad charactered people who do not have any sense of God in their behavior. How could such children become honorable and righteous like Maryam was!

Maryam was fed with religious knowledge as she was growing up. Allah says ***“…Say, Are those who know equal to those who know not?! It is only men of understanding who will remember.” (39:9)***. If a child is fed with useful knowledge while growing up, he/she will be a bright star in any society he/she be in. As much as kids are fed with knowledge about doing worldly works, they should also be fed with knowledge about Allah and their religion so that they don’t meet with an eternal loss.

Who did Maryam seek to for help when she was in total confusion? No person, but she always did put her trust in Allah. Allah in turn never forsaken her to the extent that she always received special food while she was in her worshipping place. But where do we put our trust to? Perhaps in people, money, fame and such other things. That is why Allah often forsakes us and we end up in endless struggles with our life.

Did Maryam protest at getting a pregnant she did not intend to? It was unexpected but she accepted Allah’s decree. This was a test and trial that turned into a blessing. She endured the pregnancy and all the accusations her people put to her yet she was victorious at last. Allah sends us trials not to punish us, but to make us strong and bring upon us His blessing through those trials. It would be wrong to protest any of Allah’s decree upon us.

Though Maryam got a child, she stayed all her life a virgin. It is not true that she got married to Joseph as some people claim. She was chaste and guarded her private parts. She purified her honor and was free from any kind of immorality. Just like Maryam did, good women are those who avoid bringing to themselves the attention of men and don’t go into sexual relations except with their rightful husbands. Today the world has normalized sexual immorality that those who stay away from it are being mocked at as being backward. But it is part of nature that only a few people do what is right while the majority follow their whims and desires. So our Muslim women should pick a lesson from Maryam concerning this, dress decently (not revealing any of their bodies) and staying away from sexual relations outside marriage.
