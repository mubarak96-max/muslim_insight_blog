The number one of the facts is that the Quran contains Allah’s words and His messages to mankind. Some people claim that the Quran is just a creation of Allah but that is not true. Allah is not a creation and thus His words were not created. Unlike us people, we are creations of Allah and our words are also creations of Him. The Quran, His words is one of His attributes which are eternal and uncreated. How great could be the Message of the One who is perfect and knows everything.

The Quran’s original text is in Arabic language. ***Why was it revealed in Arabic?*** The Arabic language is the mother of languages. It is the most eloquent, plain, deep and expressive of the meanings that might arise in one’s mind. Almost all languages have words that are borrowed Arabic yet it does not borrow from any other language. For example, English words like magazine, sofa, checkmate, caravan, coffee, saffron, lemon and so many others originated from Arabic.

The Quran has so far been translated in more than 100 languages and you find that different languages have different words for some meanings. It could be easy for the meaning to be altered if there is no original source. The Quran has lots of facts and one of them is that no one will tamper with its meaning.

##### First, the verses that tell us about Allah, His Attributes and Oneness giving us the knowledge about Him, for example;

*“Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which is a lamp. The lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly \[white] star lit from \[the oil of] a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire. Light upon light. Allah guides to His light whom He wills. And Allah presents examples for the people, and Allah is Knowing of all things.” (24:35)*

*“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).” (51:*56)

##### Verses that talk about rewards (paradise) and punishments (hell).

<!--StartFragment-->

They describe the two final destinations and the different conditions people will find themselves in in the afterlife, for example;

 *“And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, ‘This is what we were provided with before.’ And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.” (2:25)*

“…Those who deny (their Lord), for them will be cut out a garment of Fire. Over their heads will be poured out *boiling water. With it will be scalded what is within their bodies, as well as (their) skins. In addition there will be maces of iron (to punish) them. Every time they wish to get away therefrom, from anguish, they will be forced back, and (it will be said), “Taste the Penalty of Burning!” (22:19-22).*

##### Verses that talk about the day of resurrection and accounting, when mankind will go back to its Lord and a life of eternity, for example;

*“On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His leave. Some among them will be wretched and others blessed.” (11:105)*

*“O you who have believed, do not consume usury/interest, doubled and multiplied, but [fear](https://musliminsight.net/why-am-i-so-fearful-causes-of-fear/) Allah that you may be successful.” (3:130)*

*“O mankind, eat from whatever is on earth that is lawful and good and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.” (2:168)*

It is referred to by people in many fields even though it was revealed 1440 years ago before the world had any sense of the technology we have today.

## **The Quran is a miracle**

One of the should be mentioned facts about the Quran is its being a miracle.

## **The Quran was inscribed at Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz before being sent down**

This is the place where Allah’s decrees are kept. It is free from any increase, decrease or any change. Allah protects the Quran’s original place from having anything added or removed, or from being corrupted. He is preventing its meanings from being bent, just as He is preventing its words from being modified. He is preventing anything from being added or taken away from its characters.

## **The Quran was revealed in Ramadhan**

The Quran was revealed during the night of decree (Al-Qadr) in the month of [Ramadhan](https://musliminsight.net/the-month-of-ramadan/). This is the same month that the other Divine books were revealed to their respective prophets. For example, the Suhuf of Ibrahim, the Torah of Musa (Moses) and the Injil (Gospel) of Isa (Jesus).

A*llah says: “The month of Ramadhan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and the criterion…..” (2:185)*

*“Indeed, We sent it (the Quran) down during the Night of Decree.” (97:1)*

Allah sent the Quran down all at one time from Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz to the House of Might (Baytul Izza) which is in the heaven nearest to this world. This is where it was picked from during the period of its revelation period. The actual place and period of revelation are among the Quran facts one should know.

## **It was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) through Angel Jibril (Gabriel)**

The Quran was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) through angel [Jibril](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jibril) (Gabriel). This is the angel that could bring Allah’s message to His prophets and messengers, starting from the first ones of them Adam and Nuh (Noah) to the last ones, Isa (Jesus) and Muhammad (peace be upon them). Jibril brought the Quran to the prophet (peace be upon him) in parts. This was according to the necessity of the situation at hand and it took a period of 23 years. He taught him the Quran word by word, letter by letter, the hidden and the apparent meaning so that nothing of it is changed.

## **It was compiled into a single book after the prophet’s death (peace be upon him)**

During the 23 years of the revelation of the Quran, it was just memorized and also written on different materials like leather, bone fragments, cloth and paper. During the rulership of Abubakar, the prophet’s successor in leading Muslims, 70 of those who had memorized the Quran were all killed at once. Umar bin Al-Khattab raised the issue for the compilation of the Quran. Thereafter Ubayy ibn Kab, Uthman ibn Affan, Abdullah ibn Masood, Ali ibn Abi Talib, Khalid ibn al-Walid, Hudhaifah and Talha ibn Ubaydullah were among the 12 persons who gathered at Umar’s home to collect all the objects on which verses from the Quran were recorded.

They were written on a gazelle skin by Saeed ibn al-Aas, who was known for his beautiful calligraphy. The writing employed was the standard Arabic alphabet of the period, which was already well-established and widely used in Hejaz at the time. At a joint sitting, a version of the compiled Quran was read to the companions who were about 33,000 and no one objected.

Thus, the Quran was recorded during Muhammad’s lifetime (peace be upon him), while its compiling took place under Abu Bakr’s reign, and it was duplicated during Uthman’s leadership, which also created specific schools for perfect Quran recitation and writing.
